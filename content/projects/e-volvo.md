Relectric’s first project is the transformation of a 1966 Volvo P220 into a fully functioning electric vehicle. The vehicle was donated to our team by local electric vehicle dealer GoElectric in support of Relectric’s research and development of electric vehicles. Currently Relectric’s four teams are working hard to get our vehicle in operation:

Business: The Business team is constantly working not only to maintain a healthy relationship between our current sponsors and the team but also to recruit  potential sponsors. The team is also working on creating a master budget that will help keep Relectric on track financially. Additionally, the Business team is constantly managing all of Relectric’s social media.

Software: The Software team is currently developing a user interface that will interact with the driver. To do this, they are utilizing Python and Raspberry Pi’s. They are also working on researching how to use motors and motor controllers that will be implemented in the vehicle. The Relectric team website is also being constantly managed by the Software team.

Electrical-Mechanical: The Electrical-Mechanical team is in charge of preparing the car for the conversion from gasoline to electric powered. They have begun removing all gasoline parts and gathering the equipment necessary for the electric vehicle conversion. 

Geomatics: The Geomatics team is working towards creating a framework for the geospatial properties of the car. The end goal for the team is to figure out how to measure the location and position of the vehicle at all times. They are also looking into using sensors that will enable the vehicle to have autonomous driving features.



In the future, Relectric aims to show the vehicle off at various car shows and events to demonstrate the importance of electric vehicles in a carbon-neutral future. In the long term, our team will also be looking to start on a new project vehicle from scratch that will improve upon our current project.
