Relectric has partnered with GreenLearning, a free educational online program about energy, climate change, and green economy. GreenLearningâ€™s goal is to properly engage and empower students early on in their lives as they begin to figure out potential career paths.

Through this partnership, Relectric will develop a mentorship program for students in the GreenLearning program, specifically, their Renergy program. This will provide these young students with background knowledge on how electric cars are built and will help foster their passion for sustainable engineering. More specifically, Relectric plans to introduce students to key concepts in the world of mechanical, electrical, software, and geomatics engineering. In addition, we will introduce students to project management, a key concept that makes Relectric run like the well-oiled machine it is. GreenLearning also intends on starting their own ICE to EV conversion course, similar to what we at Relectric have been doing. By sharing our experiences, timeline goals, and information regarding the Relectric journey, we hope to expedite their process and accelerate the development of a GreenLearning electric vehicle conversion program!

Overall, the biggest goal of this collaboration is to share our passion for engineering, electric vehicles, and sustainability with the youth. An EV future is inevitable. That is why we believe informing the next generation on the topic is absolutely vital. Relectric and GreenLearning create the perfect pairing to do so!

If you have any questions or just want to tell us how amazing we are for what we are doing, please contact us [here!](https://teamrelectric.ca/contact/) :)
