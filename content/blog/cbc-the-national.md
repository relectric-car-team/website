Relecric recently had the unique opportunity to be interviewed by one of Canada’s largest news networks in CBC. The interview was featured during an episode of “The National” and aired on national television on November 7th.

This interview provided Relectric with the opportunity to invite CBC into our garage to show off our 1966 Volvo P220 and all the work we have done on it so far. The news story features clips of our mechanical, electrical, geomatics, and software teams working on the car and the various components that each team has contributed. The interview also allowed us to share our mission and goals with viewers all across Canada and will hopefully be a great tool in increasing the awareness of the Relectric brand.

We would like to say a huge thank you to CBC for coming into our garage and airing the interview on “The National”. Another massive thank you goes to everyone who has put in their time and efforts into ensuring that this was possible!
